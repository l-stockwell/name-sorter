# Name Sorter

Given a set of names, Name Sorter orders that set first by last name, then by any given names. 

## Usage

The names must be provided as a " " seperated input .txt file, and formatted as a list.
After execution, the names will be reordered by last name. The result will be printed and written/overwritten to an output .txt file.

### Executing program

* The program uses a command line argument referring to a .txt file (a default file exists in the project already)
* As long as the file name and path are not modified, this should run as expected.
```
name-sorter ./unsorted-names-list.txt
```
